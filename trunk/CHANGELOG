v0.12 - 22-Jan-2011
===================

 - Improvement: nolisten option added

   Will prevent the script from bind to $myip, port 179/tcp. This allows to
   run multiple instances at the same time, all sourced from the same ip
   address. Thanks to Adrien le Maire.

   Please note: this is in violation of RFC4271, Section 8.2.1. Because i dont
   consider neither Net::BGP nor this script a full BGP implementation, and
   given the usefulness of this parameter, i decided to add the switch; its in
   Net::BGP anyway.
   
v0.11 - 30-Dec-2010
===================

 - FIX/Improvement:  run multiple listeners at once
   
   Instead of listening to all interfaces, the script will now listen to $myip
   only. This allows for running multiple copies of the script at the same time,
   at different ip addresses.

   See google code issue #1. Thanks to Charlie Allom for pointing this out.
  

 - Improvement: Keepalive and HoldTime options added

   Its now possible to change keepalive and holdtime connection parameters. 

   See google code issue #2. Thanks to Thomas Mignien for submitting the patch.
