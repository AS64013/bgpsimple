v0.11 - 30-Dec-2010
===================

 - FIX/Improvement:  run multiple listeners at once
   
   Instead of listening to all interfaces, the script will now listen to $myip
   only. This allows for running multiple copies of the script at the same time,
   at different ip addresses.

   See google code issue #1. Thanks to Charlie Allom for pointing this out.
  

 - Improvement: Keepalive and HoldTime options added

   Its now possible to change keepalive and holdtime connection parameters. 

   See google code issue #2. Thanks to Thomas Mignien for submitting the patch.
